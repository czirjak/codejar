## Reporting a Bug (existing feature)
Please, when you report an issue, attach as many details as you can such as
1. proper description,
2. expected behaviour,
3. images,
4. timestamp (time when the issue happened)
5. and - if it is possible - steps to reproduce the issue.

## Reporting a feature request (new feature)
You can create requests to have a new feature. Please, share your ideas with proper description with some reasons about why that new feature would be useful for the community.


## In general
Please, before creating a new issue, be sure that it is not a duplicate of something which has been already reported or suggested. So please, scan the reported issues before creating a new one.
